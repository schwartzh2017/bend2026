# Winter House Olympics

*Official Rulebook & Event Guide*
*Saturday Night Competition · Sunday Morning Award Ceremony*

---

## Overview

Welcome to the Winter House Olympics! Five nations will compete across a series of winter-themed events to claim glory, medals, and the right to have their national anthem played for all to hear. May the best country win.

---

## The Teams

Teams of 2 will be randomly assigned Saturday night (one guy + girl per team — couples **will** be separated 😉). Each team will choose their country name and national anthem during the Opening Ceremony.

---

## Opening Ceremony

Before games begin Saturday evening, all teams must complete the Opening Ceremony:

- Each team chooses a country to represent (real or fictional).
- Each team selects a national anthem, which will be played after each game they win.

---

## Medal & Point System

Each event awards Gold, Silver, and Bronze medals. At the end of the night, medals are tallied for the final podium. Prizes for the top three counties are TBD.

**Tiebreaker:** In the event of a tied medal count, the team with more Gold medals wins. If still tied, a sudden-death Ping Pong rally decides it.

---

## The Events

Ten events. A mix of head-to-head, team relay, and all-play formats. We may phone a friend to assist in the chance of disputes.

### 🥌 Event 1: Whiskey Curling

*Olympic Equivalent: Curling*

Set up a target (tape a bullseye on the hardwood floor). Use a Swiffer mop as the broom and whiskey ice cubes as curling stones. Each teammate takes turns sliding one ice cube toward the bullseye. The Swiffer may be used to guide it (enthusiastically). After both teammates have thrown, measure the distance from the center. Closest team wins.

**Format:** All 5 teams compete. Each player throws 2 cubes. Best combined distance from center wins.

**Scoring:** Gold / Silver / Bronze by total distance from bullseye.

---

### 🏓 Event 2: Around-the-World Ping Pong

*Olympic Equivalent: Table Tennis*

All 10 players stand in a circle around the ping pong table. One player hits the ball over the net and immediately moves aside. The next player in line picks up the paddle and must return it before it bounces twice. Keep rotating. If you miss or double-bounce, you are eliminated. Last 2 players remaining score medals for their team.

**Format:** All 10 players participate. Last 2 standing win medals for their teams.

**Scoring:** Gold (last standing) = 3pts, Silver (2nd to last) = 2pts, Bronze = 1pt for their country.

---

### 🎵 Event 3: Interpretive Dance (Figure Skating)

*Olympic Equivalent: Figure Skating*

Each team has 90 seconds to perform an interpretive dance to an assigned song (one member dances, the other sings their selected song). Judged by a rotating panel of 3 non-competing attendees on: Artistic Impression (1–5), Athletic Effort (1–5), and Crowd Reaction (1–5). Maximum score: 15 points. Teams may use props, costumes, or choreography.

**Format:** All 5 teams perform sequentially. Judges score after each performance.

**Scoring:** Highest combined judge score wins Gold. Ties broken by Crowd Reaction score.

---

### 🎯 Event 4: Nerf Biathlon

*Olympic Equivalent: Biathlon*

Set up 5 targets at one end of a room or outside. Each athlete sprints to the shooting line, fires 5 Nerf darts at targets, then sprints back to tag their partner. Partner completes the same sequence. Total hits = score. Any miss adds a 5-second time penalty. Teams ranked by adjusted time (elapsed time + penalty seconds).

*We may use snowballs in the event we cannot find Nerf guns.*

**Format:** All 5 teams compete in timed relay format, sequentially.

**Scoring:** Fastest adjusted time wins Gold. Top 3 receive medals.

---

### 🧊 Event 5: Speed Skating Beer Mile

*Olympic Equivalent: Speed Skating*

Teams must wear ski gloves or oven mitts for the **entire** event — no removing them.

- **Station 1:** Flip Cup (each teammate flips their cup before the next station can begin).
- **Station 2:** Tie two shoes together (you must successfully tie a double knot).
- **Station 3 & 4:** TBD by host before the event.

After all stations are complete, gloves are passed off to the partner who completes the return run. Any dropped item must be picked up before moving on. No touching items without gloves.

**Format:** Head-to-head relay. Fastest combined team time wins.

**Scoring:** Gold to fastest time. Top 3 receive medals. Glove removal = 30-second penalty.

---

### ❄️ Event 6: Plank-athlon

*Olympic Equivalent: Skeleton (Endurance)*

One nominated athlete per country holds a plank outside in the snow or cold. Last person holding wins Gold for their country. Knees, hips, or elbows touching the ground = you are out. Judges observe closely. Appeals not accepted after ruling.

**Format:** One representative per country. Individual endurance event.

**Scoring:** Last plank standing = Gold. Order of dropout = Silver, Bronze, 4th, 5th.

---

### 🎿 Event 7: Skimo Sled Relay

*Olympic Equivalent: Ski Mountaineering*

Each team has one sled. Athlete 1 drags the sled up the hill, runs around the house carrying the sled, and returns to the starting point. Athlete 1 hands off the sled to Athlete 2, who completes the same course. Both athletes must complete the full course. The sled must be **carried** — not dragged — around the house portion.

**Format:** All 5 teams compete in timed relay format. Sequential or simultaneous depending on space.

**Scoring:** Fastest combined time wins Gold. Top 3 receive medals. Dragging during carry section = 15-second penalty.

---

### ❄️ Event 8: Snowball / Sardines

*Olympic Equivalent: Olympic Village (All of It)*

One person is chosen as the "hider" (volunteer or random draw). They hide anywhere in the house. All other players count to 60. Then everyone searches individually and separately. When you find the hider, you silently squeeze into the hiding spot with them. The last person to find the sardine pile loses 2 points for their country (yes, negative points are possible). If a seeker finds the pile and there is no room, they must wait nearby, visible, until there is space.

**Format:** All 10 players participate.

**Scoring:** Last to find the pile = −2pts. First to find = +1 bonus pt (bragging rights).

---

### 🎮 Event 9: Nintendo Switch Snowball Fight

*Olympic Equivalent: Olympic Snowball Combat*

Compete on the Switch snowball fight game (1v1 or team format depending on the game's mode). Teams compete in a bracket format. Losers are eliminated; winners advance. The host will set up the bracket before play begins. Each match is best of 3 rounds. Controllers will be rotated between teammates for each round.

**Format:** Tournament bracket. Each match is best of 3 rounds. Teams rotate controllers.

**Scoring:** Tournament winner = Gold. Runner-up = Silver. 3rd place = Bronze.

---
